# Data_Science_Multivariable_Linear_Regression
In this exercise I created a predicted earnings with all columns in the data frame, to know how well the predicted used Multivariable Linear Regression.
As the result, it's really not satisfied with the result. I got earnings only $2.78 per hour and it's really silly cause I include columns like ID to become a features.
It could be some improvement, you could remove columns like ID before did some prediction.
